# IQ-TREE
# IQ-TREE was executed employing mixture models, since finite mixture models such as C10-C60 (Le et al. 2008), 
# and a faster approximation of these models known as  “posterior mean site frequency” (PMSF) model (Wang et al., 2018), 
# both of which are implemented in IQtree, have been proposed to capture the heterogeneity in amino acid preferences at sites. 
# True C10-C60 trees are computationally more demanding (Table S10), and we therefore opted for the faster approximation based on the 
# PMSF model. The ar.122.r89 tree was calculated with IQ-TREE v1.6.12 based on the C10 mixture model and a starting tree (-ft), 
# for which we used the FastTree described above, to invoke the faster PMSF approximation:
