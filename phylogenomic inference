# IQ-TREE
# IQ-TREE was executed employing mixture models, since finite mixture models such as C10-C60 (Le et al. 2008), 
# and a faster approximation of these models known as  “posterior mean site frequency” (PMSF) model (Wang et al., 2018), 
# both of which are implemented in IQtree, have been proposed to capture the heterogeneity in amino acid preferences at sites. 
# True C10-C60 trees are computationally more demanding (Table S10), and we therefore opted for the faster approximation based on the 
# PMSF model. The ar.122.r89 tree was calculated with IQ-TREE v1.6.12 based on the C10 mixture model and a starting tree (-ft), 
# for which we used the FastTree described above, to invoke the faster PMSF approximation: 

iqtree -s  <input alignment>     -nt AUTO   -m LG+C10+F+G  -ft  <starting tree>  -pre  <prefix of output files> 


# ExaML
# ExaMl trees (gamma, JTT) were calculated from 10 different starting trees with random seeds using ExaML version 3.0.20, 
# whereby the tree with the highest likelihood score was retained: 

mpirun.openmpi -np <number of threads>  examl-AVX  -s  <transformed binary input alignment> -t <starting tree with best likelihood> -m  GAMMA -n  <output prefix> -D



# SUPERTREES - ASTRAL
# Supertrees were calculated from 1) 122 GTDB markers, and 2) from 253 markers which were present in >10% of archaeal genomes and were 
# extracted from the  PhyloPhlAn dataset (Segata et al., 2013). 
# For the 122 marker set maximum-likelihood (ML) inference was performed for each marker genes using the C10 + PSMF model in IQ-Tree. 
# For each marker gene, a guide tree was inferred via approximate ML using FastTree v2.1.9  with the WAG model and gamma distributed 
# rate heterogeneity. A complete ML tree was then inferred using IQ-Tree v 1.6.9 with the C10 + PMSF model with 100 non-parametric 
# bootstrap samplings to assess node support. A consensus tree was constructed using the individual gene trees using ASTRAL v5.6.3.
